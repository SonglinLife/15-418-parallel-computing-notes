**Two significant reasons for Moore's Law**: Exploiting instruction level parallelism and increasing CPU clock cycles.

ILP means that even though instructions appear to execute in program order, independent instructions can be executed simultaneously by a processor.

**Diminishing benefit of superscalar execution**: Increasing instructions per clock cycle does not result in much speed up after a certain extent. Programs have other dependencies that cannot be sped up.

**The power wall**: Increasing processor speed requires high power which produces high heat.
